# train_scheduler

Train scheduler is an app that will tell the user when a requested train will be arriving and the tell you how much time till the next train comes. The user inputs the name of the train and where it's going, what time the first train will be and how many minutes after that the following train will come. 

The project is great because it applies to real time and adjusts with time, it gives the user interactivity and scheduling within the app. 

The code includes html, css, js, firebase, jquery, moment.js, which offers the aspect of timing to the app. Firebase provides the database access so if you refresh the screen the data is still available.
